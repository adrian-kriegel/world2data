# Demo Video Script (60s max)

## Goal
Show real-world impact and visible functionality.

## Timeline
0-07s: Hook
- "World2Data turns a single phone video into a simulation-ready 3D world model."

07-16s: Input + run
- Show raw input clip and command trigger.
- Overlay: "33s source video, processed end-to-end."

16-34s: Rerun playback (key proof)
- evolving point cloud
- camera trajectory
- object overlays/state labels
- scrub from first to last frame to prove full-span processing

34-48s: Artifact handoff
- `.usda`
- `_scene_graph.json`
- `.rrd`
- `.ply`

48-60s: Close with value + honesty
- "We already generate interoperable 3D assets and temporal traces from plain video."
- "Next hardening step is strict OpenUSD layer composition and QA override workflows."

## Recording Checklist
- Record 1080p, 30fps.
- Add subtitles (important for judge clarity).
- Keep one visual per statement; avoid fast cuts.
