# Demo Video Script (60s max)

## Goal
Show real-world impact and visible functionality.

## Timeline
0-06s: "World2Data converts a normal video into a simulation-ready 3D scene."

06-18s: Show raw input video clip (real room / environment).

18-35s: Show Rerun timeline playback:
- evolving point cloud
- camera trajectory
- object overlays/state labels

35-48s: Show generated artifacts quickly:
- `.usda`
- `_scene_graph.json`
- `.ply`

48-60s: Close with impact:
"This removes hours of manual scene setup and enables faster robotics/simulation iteration from everyday video."

## Recording Checklist
- Record 1080p, 30fps.
- Add subtitles (important for judge clarity).
- Keep one visual per statement; avoid fast cuts.
